### Repository Name: Play Predictor with KNN

### Description:
This repository contains code for a play predictor model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model predicts whether a sports team will play a match based on various features such as weather conditions, team performance, etc.

### Overview:
This project aims to build a predictive model for determining whether a sports team will play a match using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The implementation is done in Python, and the code is available in both a script (`play_predictor_knn.py`) and a Jupyter Notebook (`Play_Predictor_KNN.ipynb`).

### Dataset:
The model utilizes a dataset containing historical data on team play decisions. Features include weather conditions, team performance, and other relevant factors. The target variable indicates whether the team played or not.

### Requirements:
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/play-predictor-knn.git
cd play-predictor-knn
```

2. Run the code:

```bash
python play_predictor_knn.py
```

Explore the Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis and results.

### File Structure:
- `play_predictor_knn.py`: Python script with the KNN model implementation.
- `Play_Predictor_KNN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for exploration, implementation, and analysis.

### Results:
The model achieves an accuracy of [your_accuracy] on the test set.
